Tasks: Worked on and off on functions.js (probably about 2 hours of work). Completed useless function and mostly completed the bar doubling function. Still needs a little debugging and fine tuning.

Tasks: Completed the bar doubling function, did some tiding up of the code in variables.js, and researched string parsing and Date objects for parseGit function.

Tasks: Completed parseGit function including troubleshooting. Originally parsed the time into multiple strings and numbers to be used in format: var = new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, second). When that did not produce the necessary result for the test I instead joined the parsed time strings into a single string to be passed as the argument in format: var = new Date('date string').

Tasks: Created .html file, .css file, and .js file for Assignment 3 Part 2. Created layout of webpage in .html file. Minor styling done in .css file. In .js file (using an array of fake urls and descriptions) I implemented the search feature which dynamically created a list of search results in the search results dl. These results displayed the description as a hyperlink to the url. I also implemented the dynamic creation of buttons for 'Add to favorites' and 'Remove from Favorites'. I got the 'Add to Favorites' function working including storing value pairs of descriptions and urls in local storage. Still need to make the search results filter out the gists stored in the favorites.

Tasks: Implemented the search results filter based on gists in the favorites (local storage) and also successfully implemented the 'Remove from Favorites' functionality. Now need to utilize the httpRequest object to pull the data from GitHub to fill my array of descriptions, urls, and languages instead of my randomly generated values.

Start: Sun, 1 Feb 2015 7:15:00 -0800
End: Sun, 1 Feb 2015 10:03:54 -0800
Tasks: Committing .js file which now creates an array of values of GitHub Gists parsed from the XML response from GitHub. Need to replace current array of fake values with this array and ensure other features still work.

Start: Sun, 1 Feb 2015 12:45:00 -0800
End: Sun, 1 Feb 2015 14:01:29 -0800
Tasks: Successfully replaced fake array with array produced by parsing XML request. It took some debugging of the existing function but the array is now used to create the search results. Add to Favorites and Remove from Favorites buttons still work and Gists in the Favorites do not appear in the Search Results. Still need to implement the multiple page search and filter by language features.

Tasks: Committing completed .js file which now implements filter by code language and multiple page searches.
