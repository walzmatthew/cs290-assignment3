Tasks: Completed parseGit function including troubleshooting. Originally parsed the time into multiple strings and numbers to be used in format: var = new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, second). When that did not produce the necessary result for the test I instead joined the parsed time strings into a single string to be passed as the argument in format: var = new Date('date string').
